## About

Reads remote add-on repositories, determines versions and generates
changelogs to update the add-on repository fully automated.

Mainly used by the Community Hass.io add-ons project.

Please note, this program cannot be used with the general documented
Hass.io add-on repository approach and only works in the setup where
each add-on has its own GitHub repository.

## Installation

Using pip, the Python package manager:

```bash
pip install repository-updater
```

## Usage

The Repository Updater is a pretty simple, straightforward CLI tool.

```txt
Usage: repository-updater [OPTIONS]

  Community Hass.io Add-ons Repository Updater.

Options:
  --token <TOKEN>                 GitHub access token
  --repository <orgname/reponame>
                                  The Hassio Addons repository to update
  --addon <TARGET>                Update a single/specific add-on
  --force                         Force an update of the add-on repository
  --version                       Show the version and exit.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

## Using Docker

The Repository Updater has been packaged in a Docker container as well.
This allows for easy and quick use, without the need for a Python setup. This
can be quite useful when using this tool in a CI server like; Travis,
CircleCI or GitLab CI.

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm hassioaddons/repository-updater:latest
```

All the usage information parameters from the previous chapter apply.
For example, this shows the current version of the tool:

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm hassioaddons/repository-updater:latest --version
```

## Add-ons Repository Configuration

In order for the Repository Updater to do its job, we need feed it some
information. It needs to know which add-ons there are currently in the 
add-ons repository and where each add-on is located on GitHub.

Secondly, it needs to know the stability channel of the add-ons repository.
There are 3 stability channel levels available:

- **stable**: Stable releases
- **beta**: Beta / test releases
- **edge**: Latest builds, usually build straight from development

Create a `.hassio-addons.yml` file in the root of the add-ons repository,
which looks like this:

```yaml
channel: edge
addons:
  example:
    repository: hassio-addons/addon-example
    target: example
    image: hassioaddons/example-{arch}
  homebridge:
    repository: hassio-addons/addon-homebridge
    target: homebridge
    image: hassioaddons/homebridge-{arch}
  pihole:
    repository: hassio-addons/addon-pi-hole
    target: pi-hole
    image: hassioaddons/pi-hole-{arch}
```

The target in the add-ons repository is specified as the key for each add-on,
this will be the directory name inside the add-ons repository as well. This is
different from the `target` key, in a way that that key specified the add-on
target directory inside the git repository of the add-on itself.

In the above example, `pihole` will be the name of the add-on directory
inside the add-ons repository, while `pi-hole` is the directory in the add-on
git repo that contains the actual add-on.

`repository` specified the location of the add-on on GitHub. This must be
in `organization/repository` or `username/repository` format.

Finally, the `image` key defines the Docker container images on Docker Hub
for this add-on. `{arch}` can be used as a placeholder for the architecture and
is automatically replaced internally by the Repository Updater.

## Add-ons Repository README template

It is nice to have an up to date `README.md` file in your add-ons repository,
but maintaining one, can be quite time-consuming. The Repository updater is 
able to update the `README.md` file for you each run.

This is done using a Jinja2 template. Simply create a file called `.README.j2`
in the root of your add-ons repository. Most information is collected
from the add-on `config.json` and GitHub repo. 

A variable `addons` is passed into your template file upon rendering, containing
a list of the following dictionaries:

- **name**: Name of the add-on
- **description**: Description of the add-on
- **url**: URL of the add-on
- **repo**: URL to the add-on GitHub repo
- **archs**: List of supported architectures by this add-on
- **slug**: The add-on slug
- **target**: The target directory of the add-on inside the add-ons repository
- **image**: The (untouched) Docker Hub container image name
- **images**: Dictionary of images per architecture
    - **aarch64**: `aarch64` DockerHub image (if arch is supported)
    - **amd64**: `amd64` DockerHub image (if arch is supported)
    - **armhf**: `armhf` DockerHub image (if arch is supported)
    - **i386**: `i386` DockerHub image (if arch is supported)
- **version**: The version of the add-on
- **commit**: Full SHA of the commit bound to the current version
- **date**: Date and time of the above commit/version

## Examples

It is quite a complex setup to create an example for in this little document.
Nevertheless, see the [Community Hass.io Addons Repository][repository] for an
example of `.README.j2` and `.hassio-addons.yml` files.

The community project also uses GitLab for building its add-ons. Each
add-on runs this tool upon build, ensuring the repositories are always up to
date. Be sure to check some of the add-ons out as well to learn more about
the whole setup.

## Why do this all?

Let me start by saying, there is nothing with the documented way of setting
up a Hass.io add-ons repository. If you are just starting out developing
add-ons, please use the official documented way. You can always decide to
change your workflow.

Nevertheless, there are some advantages using the alternative method:

- Each add-on has its own Git repository, which allows for a maximum separation
  of concerns. Each add-on has its own issue list, releases, and all other
  GitHub goodness.
- Release and versioning is based on GitHub Releases / Git tagging. Which
  does not need updating of configuration files and is done with a single click.
- Each add-on Git repository is downloadable and instantly buildable locally.
- Every single piece of manual labor around maintaining an add-ons repository
  is fully automated. Building, testing, quality control, publishing, changelogs
  and even the add-ons repository README are updated automatically.  This level
  of automation allows us to focus completely on developing the actual add-on.
- Availability of Beta and Edge channels for everyone who's interested or
  willing to test.
  
## Known issues and limitations

- The README template is currently mandatory in future releases this will
  be made optional.
- Any kind of testing and linting... is missing...

## Changelog & Releases

This repository keeps a [change log](CHANGELOG.md). The format of the log
is based on [Keep a Changelog][keepchangelog].

Releases are based on [Semantic Versioning][semver], and use the format
of ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``. In a nutshell, the version will be incremented
based on the following:

- ``MAJOR``: Incompatible or major changes.
- ``MINOR``: Backwards-compatible new features and enhancements.
- ``PATCH``: Backwards-compatible bugfixes and package updates.
