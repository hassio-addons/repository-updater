## About

Reads remote add-on repositories, determines versions and generates
changelogs to update the add-on repository fully automated.

Mainly used by the Community Home Assistant Add-ons project.

Please note, this program cannot be used with the general documented
Home Assistant add-on repository approach and only works in the setup where
each add-on has its own GitHub repository.

## Installation

Using pip, the Python package manager:

```bash
pip install repository-updater
```

## Usage

The Repository Updater is a pretty simple, straightforward CLI tool.

```txt
Usage: repository-updater [OPTIONS]

  Community Home Assistant Add-ons Repository Updater.

Options:
  --token <TOKEN>                 GitHub access token
  --repository <orgname/reponame>
                                  The Home Assistant Addons repository to update
  --addon <TARGET>                Update a single/specific add-on
  --force                         Force an update of the add-on repository
  --version                       Show the version and exit.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

To get a GitHub token, please see the GitHub article: [Create a token][token]

## Using Docker

The Repository Updater has been packaged in a Docker container as well.
This allows for easy and quick use, without the need for a Python setup. This
can be quite useful when using this tool in a CI server like; Travis,
CircleCI or GitLab CI.

```bash
docker run -it --rm hassioaddons/repository-updater:latest
```

All the usage information parameters from the previous chapter apply.
For example, this shows the current version of the tool:

```bash
docker run -it --rm hassioaddons/repository-updater:latest --version
```

## Using a GitHub Action

The Repository Updater is also available as a GitHub Action.

```yaml
---
name: Repository Update

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: ["update"]

jobs:
  whatever:
    name: Running updater for ${{ github.event.client_payload.addon }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: ðŸš€ Run Repository Updater
        uses: hassio-addons/repository-updater@v1
        with:
          addon: ${{ github.event.client_payload.addon }}
          repository: ${{ github.repository }}
          token: ${{ secrets.UPDATER_TOKEN }}
```

Once that workflow is in place, from an add-on repository, you can trigger
the above workflow to run. This can be done by dispatching a signal to
the updater workflow:

```yaml
publish:
  name: ðŸ“¢ Publish Add-on
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: ðŸš€ Dispatch Repository Updater update signal
      uses: peter-evans/repository-dispatch@v1
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.DISPATCH_TOKEN }}
        repository: hassio-addons/repository
        event-type: update
        client-payload: '{"addon": "my-addon"}'
```

## Add-ons Repository Configuration

In order for the Repository Updater to do its job, we need feed it some
information. It needs to know which add-ons there are currently in the
add-ons repository and where each add-on is located on GitHub.

Secondly, it needs to know the stability channel of the add-ons repository.
There are 3 stability channel levels available:

- **stable**: Stable releases
- **beta**: Beta / test releases
- **edge**: Latest builds, usually build straight from development

Create a `.addons.yml` file in the root of the add-ons repository,
which looks like this:

```yaml
channel: edge
addons:
  example:
    repository: hassio-addons/addon-example
    target: example
    image: hassioaddons/example-{arch}
  another:
    repository: hassio-addons/addon-another
    target: homebridge
    image: ghcr.io/hassio-addons/test-{arch}
  demo:
    repository: hassio-addons/addon-demo
    target: src
    image: ghcr.io/hassio-addons/demo/{arch}
```

The target in the add-ons repository is specified as the key for each add-on,
this will be the directory name inside the add-ons repository as well. This is
different from the `target` key, in a way that that key specified the add-on
target directory inside the git repository of the add-on itself.

In the above example, `demo` will be the name of the add-on directory
inside the add-ons repository, while `src` is the directory in the add-on
git repo that contains the actual add-on.

`repository` specified the location of the add-on on GitHub. This must be
in `organization/repository` or `username/repository` format.

Finally, the `image` key defines the Docker container images on Docker Hub
or the GitHub Container Registry for this add-on. `{arch}` can be used as a
placeholder for the architecture and is automatically replaced internally by
the Repository Updater.

## Add-ons Repository README template

It is nice to have an up to date `README.md` file in your add-ons repository,
but maintaining one, can be quite time-consuming. The Repository updater is
able to update the `README.md` file for you each run.

This is done using a Jinja2 template. Simply create a file called `.README.j2`
in the root of your add-ons repository. Most information is collected
from the add-on `config.json` and GitHub repo.

The following variables are available in your templates and are passed into it
upon rendering your template.

- **addons**: A list of add-ons in this add-ons repository
- **channel**: The channel type of this add-ons repository
- **description**: The GitHub add-ons repository description
- **homepage**: The GitHub add-ons repository specified homepage URL
- **issues**: The URL to the issues listing of the GitHub add-ons repository
- **name**: The full GitHub name, e.g., `hassio-addons/repository`
- **repo**: The full URL to the GitHub add-ons repository

In the above variables, a list of `addons` was specified. Each item in this
list contains the following variables:

- **name**: Name of the add-on
- **description**: Description of the add-on
- **url**: URL of the add-on
- **repo**: URL to the add-on GitHub repo
- **archs**: List of supported architectures by this add-on
- **slug**: The add-on slug
- **target**: The target directory of the add-on inside the add-ons repository
- **image**: The (untouched) Docker Hub container image name
- **images**: Dictionary of images per architecture
  - **aarch64**: `aarch64` DockerHub image (if arch is supported)
  - **amd64**: `amd64` DockerHub image (if arch is supported)
  - **armhf**: `armhf` DockerHub image (if arch is supported)
  - **i386**: `i386` DockerHub image (if arch is supported)
- **version**: The version of the add-on
- **commit**: Full SHA of the commit bound to the current version
- **date**: Date and time of the above commit/version

## Examples

It is quite a complex setup to create an example for in this little document.
Nevertheless, see the [Community Home Assistant Addons Repository][repository]
for an example of `.README.j2` and `.addons.yml` files.

The community project also uses GitLab for building its add-ons. Each
add-on runs this tool upon build, ensuring the repositories are always up to
date. Be sure to check some of the add-ons out as well to learn more about
the whole setup.

## Why do this all

Let me start by saying, there is nothing wrong with the documented way of
setting up a Home Assistant add-ons repository. If you are just starting out
developing add-ons, please use the official documented way. You can always
decide to change your workflow.

Nevertheless, there are some advantages using the alternative method:

- Each add-on has its own Git repository, which allows for a maximum separation
  of concerns. Each add-on has its own issue list, releases, and all other
  GitHub goodness.
- Release and versioning is based on GitHub Releases / Git tagging. Which
  does not need updating of configuration files and is done with a single click.
- Each add-on Git repository is downloadable and instantly buildable locally.
- Every single piece of manual labor around maintaining an add-ons repository
  is fully automated. Building, testing, quality control, publishing, changelogs
  and even the add-ons repository README are updated automatically.  This level
  of automation allows us to focus completely on developing the actual add-on.
- Availability of Beta and Edge channels for everyone who's interested or
  willing to test.

## Known issues and limitations

- Any kind of testing and linting... is missing...

## Changelog & Releases

This repository keeps a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality.
